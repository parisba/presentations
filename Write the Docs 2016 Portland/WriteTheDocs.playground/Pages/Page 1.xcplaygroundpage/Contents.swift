 ## Basics Putting Birds on It with Swift
 This playground uses [Swift](http://swift.org) and Emoji to show some basic maths.
 - - -
 First, we need to create the world and everything in it:
*/
var 🌍 = "🚙📗🏠"
/*:
 * callout(Emoji is everywhere):
 Yep, Swift supports Emoji pretty much everywhere!
 */
/*:
Next, we create some temporary working space to store the world, and the birds in:
*/
var 💩 = ""
/*:
 Then, we step through everything in the world, and add a bird to it:
*/
for 📦 in 🌍.characters {
    💩 = 💩 + "🐦" + String(📦)
}
/*:
 And, finally, we display the world, with birds added:
*/
print(💩)

/*:
 - important:
 "Never use emoji in your code."
